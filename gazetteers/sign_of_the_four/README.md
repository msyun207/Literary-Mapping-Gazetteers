# Gazetteer: *The Sign of the Four* (1890)

This folder contains the **literary gazetteer data and documentation** for  
Arthur Conan Doyle’s *The Sign of the Four* (1890).

The gazetteer was created as part of the *Literary Mapping Gazetteers* project and
serves as a **case study** demonstrating how gazetteer-based digital mapping can
support literary interpretation and pedagogy.

## Purpose of This Gazetteer

This gazetteer models the **spatial structure of the novel** by transforming place
references in the text into structured, interpretable data.

Rather than treating locations as neutral geographic coordinates, the gazetteer
encodes **interpretive attributes** that reflect how places function within the
narrative, including their emotional charge and narrative relevance.

The goal is to enable spatial visualization that supports **close reading,
historical interpretation, and critical inquiry**, especially with regard to
imperial and metropolitan space.

## Source Text

- Arthur Conan Doyle, *The Sign of the Four* (1890)
- Gazetteer entries are based on close reading of **Chapters 1–9**

The selection of chapters reflects the narrative concentration of spatial movement
and the introduction of key metropolitan and colonial locations.

## What the Gazetteer Contains

The gazetteer records **named places** mentioned in the text and annotates them
according to several interpretive dimensions, including:

- **Place name** as it appears in the text  
- **Working place name** (e.g. French --> France, Indian --> India)  
- **Narrative function/Type of place**, such as:
  - site of a narrated event  
  - origin of characters, objects, or information  
  - background or contextual reference
- **Emotional valence (sentiment)** associated with the place, based on narrative
  context  

These attributes are designed to support spatial visualization and comparison rather
than cartographic precision alone.

## Interpretive Principles

Several principles guide the construction of this gazetteer:

- **Human judgment is central**  
  All annotations are the result of close reading and interpretive decision-making,
  not automated extraction.

- **Literary space is not equivalent to geographic space**  
  Locations in the novel are treated as narrative constructs shaped by genre,
  perspective, and historical context.

- **Imperial space is affectively structured**  
  Colonial locations are often associated with danger, threat, or other negative
  affect, while metropolitan spaces exhibit more varied emotional patterns.

- **Ambiguity is preserved**  
  When a place serves multiple narrative roles or carries mixed affect, this is
  reflected in the data rather than resolved artificially.

## Data Files

This folder contains the following files:

- `The Sign of the Four_Gazetteer_Chs.1-9.xls`  
  The primary gazetteer file, containing annotated place data for Chapters 1–9.

Additional formats (e.g. CSV) may be added for visualization or reuse.

---

## Use and Reuse

This gazetteer may be used for:

- digital mapping and visualization (e.g. with Datawrapper)  
- classroom exercises in literary mapping  
- comparative studies of literary space  
- methodological demonstrations of gazetteer making  

Users are encouraged to adapt the schema for other texts while maintaining
transparency about interpretive choices.

## Relationship to the Project

This gazetteer is the **first completed case study** in the
*Literary Mapping Gazetteers* repository.

It is intended to function as:

- a model for future gazetteers  
- a reference example for students and researchers  
- a bridge between literary analysis and spatial humanities methods
